Learning through the FNB App Academy - practicing projects and lessons.

# FNB App Academy Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome! This repository is a personal collection of my work, practice projects, and experiments as I learn and grow through the **FNB App Academy** program.

## ðŸ“š What this is about

I'm currently participating in the FNB App Academy, where I'm learning a wide range of software development skillsâ€”from foundational programming concepts to real-world project development. This repo showcases everything I'm working on, including:

- Practice exercises
- Guided projects
- Self-exploration based on what weâ€™re taught
- Experimentation and fun!

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Reinforce what I'm learning through hands-on practice
- Track my progress over time
- Build a portfolio of work that reflects my learning journey
- Have fun while growing as a developer!

## ðŸ™Œ Why this matters

Learning by doing is one of the best ways to grow in tech, and this repository is where I bring that to life. Every line of code here represents something I've learned, struggled with, and improved onâ€”and I'm proud of that!

Thanks for checking out my work!
