                <h3>INSECTS</h3>
                <p>Insects are the most diverse group of animals on Earth, with over a million known species and many more yet to be discovered.</p>
                <p>Insects belong to the class Insecta and are characterized by having three main body parts (head, thorax, and abdomen), six legs, and usually one or two pairs of wings. They are found in nearly every environment, from rainforests to deserts, and play vital roles in ecosystems, such as pollination, decomposition, and serving as a food source for many animals.</p>
                <p>The word "insect" comes from the Latin insectum, meaning "cut into," referring to the segmented appearance of their bodies. Despite their small size, insects are essential to the balance of life on Earth.</p>
