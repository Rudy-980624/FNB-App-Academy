                <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                <p>The dusky leaf monkey, spectacled langur, or spectacled leaf monkey (Trachypithecus obscurus) is a species of primate in the family Cercopithecidae. It is found in Malaysia, Burma, and Thailand.</p>
                <p>The name "leaf monkey" refers to their leaf-heavy diet, which is supported by a complex, multi-chambered stomach adapted for fermenting plant matter. Despite their shy nature, dusky leaf monkeys are social animals, often found in small groups led by a dominant male.</p>
