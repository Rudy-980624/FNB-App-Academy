                <h3>RHINO-BEETLE</h3>
                <p>The rhino beetle is found in tropical and subtropical regions around the world, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it is known for its strength and striking appearance.</p>
                <p>The rhino beetle, belonging to the subfamily Dynastinae, is one of the largest beetles in the world. Males are known for the large, horn-like structures on their heads, which they use to fight for mates—resembling the horns of a rhinoceros, hence the name. Despite their fearsome look, rhino beetles are harmless to humans.</p>
                <p>The name “rhino beetle” comes from their distinctive horn, which varies in shape and size among species. These beetles are also among the strongest creatures on Earth relative to their size, capable of lifting objects over 80 times their own body weight.</p>
