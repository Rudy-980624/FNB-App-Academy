                <h3>TIGER</h3>
                <p>The tiger is native to Asia and is most commonly found in countries like India, Russia, and Indonesia, where it inhabits forests, grasslands, and mangroves.</p>
                <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest member of the cat family and is known for its distinctive orange coat with black stripes. Tigers are solitary and territorial predators, relying on stealth and strength to hunt large prey such as deer and wild boar. Several subspecies exist, including the Bengal, Siberian, and Sumatran tigers.</p>
                <p>The name "tiger" is derived from the Greek word tigris, which may have origins in Persian. As apex predators, tigers play a key role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems, but many populations are threatened due to habitat loss and poaching.</p>
